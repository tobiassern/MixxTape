<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>

<p>This is a project created for the Fullstack Nanodegree Item Catalog project.</p>

<p>Users can create playlists and add songs to their playlists. Which they can share with the world through facebook or twitter.</p>

<p>When creating songs users can add links to spotify, deezer, apple music and youtube in order for the ones visiting the song to use the streaming service that suits them best.</p>

<p>Songs are not owned by any user and thus can be added to any playlist when created.</p>

<p>If a user removes a song from their playlist the song will not be deleted as it can be used in other playlists</p>

<p>All users can contribute and edit a song another user has created in order to fix spellingerrors or adding / updating streaming links.</p>

<p>This project enhanced my skills in python in general but sql, sqllite, sqlalchemy, json api endpoints, oAuth and social logins specifically.</p>
